<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>Plot all mean scores (as line plots) on same plot - hover to highlight a single plot (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52532428/highlight-all-values-from-a-group-on-hover" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52532428/highlight-all-values-from-a-group-on-hover</a>)
we might not be able to do this with a static site, look into it</p>
<p>Get round labeled and do stuff (bias table/plot for round types maybe)</p>
<p>do score prediction based on difficulty, player average, and round label/maybe biases</p>
</div>
<div id="to-do" class="section level2">
<h2>To Do</h2>
<p>Finish player plots</p>
<p>Format output so we donâ€™t have to scroll through dozens of charts to find the right one</p>
<p>Format bias table and plot it, make a bar chart for the biases for each person</p>
</div>
