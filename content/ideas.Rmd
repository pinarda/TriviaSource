## Ideas

Get rounds labeled and do stuff (bias table/plot for round types maybe)

do score prediction based on difficulty, player average, and round label/maybe biases

## To Do

Format output so we don't have to scroll through dozens of charts to find the right one

Whose nights get Jokered most, how often was it the correct choice to joker their rounds

Clustering similar players using the covariance/similarity matrix
