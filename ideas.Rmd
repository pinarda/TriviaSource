```

## Ideas

Plot all mean scores (as line plots) on same plot - hover to highlight a single plot (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52532428/highlight-all-values-from-a-group-on-hover)

Get round labeled and do stuff (bias table/plot for round types maybe)

do score prediction based on difficulty, player average, and round label/maybe biases

## To Do

Finish player plots

Format bias table and plot it

Make a bar chart for the biases for each person
